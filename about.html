                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    My name is Brandon Foley, and I am a sophomore at Chapman University.
                    My passion for computing started at the beginning of high school.
                    I first tried out a graphic design class because the coding
                    classes were all full. Graphic design, while fun, was not for me,
                    and the following year, when I took my first coding class,
                    I truly fell in love with it. Since then, I have dived head-first into
                    coding with my projects in multiple courses and ultimately decided to major
                    in computer science in college. I have been coding since 2021 and constantly
                    seek new challenges or opportunities. I love working in teams and alone,
                    each of which has advantages. Working in teams allows for various ideas
                    and approaches, and problem-solving can be easier and more efficient with
                    more people. I also enjoy personal projects to help showcase myself and my
                    capabilities. My future goals are to join a company working with AI or
                    create my own product. I am also highly interested in quantum computing
                    and am looking into that more. In addition, I have interned for a tech start-up based
                    out of New York, Munnch Insights. For them I developed a frontened ordering platform
                    that is used today in their resturant.<br><br> In addition, I am also an athlete on the
                    track and field team at Chapman and enjoy working out and being outdoors.
                    I am always up for a thrill, whether hiking, snorkeling, or anything else
                    active. I also love to travel and have visited over 25 National Parks throughout
                    the United States. I can't wait to further my experiences in coding, athletics,
                    and life in general. I am always looking for something new and exciting, and I
                    can’t wait to see what the future holds.
