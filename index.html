            <h2><br>About Me</h2>
            <p><br>My name is Brandon Foley, and I am currently a sophomore at Chapman University. 
                My interest in computer science began during high school, where I initially explored 
                graphic design due to the unavailability of coding classes. However, I soon realized 
                that graphic design was not for me. It was not until the following year, when I enrolled 
                in my first coding class, that my love for programming started. This experience led me to 
                pursue a major in computer science at the university level. Since 2021, I have been dedicated 
                to honing my coding skills and actively seeking new challenges and opportunities. <br><br>
                I am keen on collaborative as well as independent work, each presenting distinct 
                advantages. Working within a team setting fosters a diverse range of ideas and approaches, 
                allowing for more efficient problem-solving. Conversely, pursuing personal projects enables me 
                to showcase my individual capabilities. Looking ahead, my aspirations involve contributing to an 
                AI-oriented company or developing my own technological innovations. I also maintain a strong interest 
                in quantum computing, an area I am actively exploring.<br><br>
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a committed athlete on Chapman University's track and field 
                team. I derive great fulfillment from physical activities and outdoor experiences, such as hiking and 
                snorkeling. Moreover, I have a profound passion for travel and have explored over 25 National Parks 
                across the United States. I eagerly anticipate the prospect of broadening my coding expertise, engaging 
                in athletics, and experiencing all that life has to offer. Continuously driven by a thirst for novelty and 
                adventure, I am excited to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.<br>

                <h3>CHOC AWS Datathon Project Winner</h3>
                <p>Utilized python and its many libraries to create neural networks, linear regression, and random forest models to try and make the best use of the data that we could. We used real data from the medical world to develop this program and perform preprocessing. </p>

                <h3>AWS Deep Racer Event Winner</h3>
                <p>I designed a reward function to optimize the performance of a car on a race track, utilizing Python and AWS for the development and testing of the reward function. Additionally, I was honored with an award for achieving the fastest car among all participants.</p>
