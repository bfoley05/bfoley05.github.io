            <h3>CHOC AWS Datathon Project Winner</h3>
            <p>Utilized python and its many libraries to create neural networks, linear regression, and random forest models to try and make the best use of the data that we could. We used real data from the medical world to develop this program and perform preprocessing. </p>

            <h3>AWS Deep Racer Event Winner</h3>
            <p>Developed a reward function to develop the fastest car around a track using Python and AWS to develop and test the reward function. In addition I received prizes for the fastest car out of all participants </p>

            <h3>LA Hacks Project</h3>
            <p>Led the development of an innovative project aimed at using AI technology to analyze various factors of a person's body to generate personalized workout materials. Our team developed two large language models integrated into our website, one utilizing OpenCV and the other leveraging Google's Gemini AI. In addition, we created a Python-based platform called REFLEX to serve as both the frontend and backend of the project.</p>

            <h3>Secure Medical Database System</h3>
            <p>Created a comprehensive and secure medical database to store drugs and other prescriptions. I also included mock health records to simulate real patients. In addition I used an API to connect to all teh medicine that are "in stock" at the counter.</p>

            <h3>Autonomous Car</h3>
            <p>Engineered and created a autonomous car from scratch, handwiring the car using an arduino breadboard. In addition I used soldering and 3D printing to assist in the build. Using an Arduino IDE I wrote code to have the program avoid objects using multiple ultrasonic sensors</p>
